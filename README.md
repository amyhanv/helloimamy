# Hello, I'm Amy. :information_desk_person:

This is my personal website that includes links to my contact/social media information as well as projects I've worked on! 

To-do still:
- [ ] add legit projects cards to index
- [ ] add Projects page
- [ ] add individual pages for each project
- [ ] create and add logo
- [ ] :fire:


* In the [history](https://github.com/amyhanv/helloimamy/tree/gh-pages/history) directory, you can view all the landing pages I've had in the past and old pages used.
